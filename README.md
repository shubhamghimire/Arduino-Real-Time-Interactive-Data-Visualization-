# Real-Time Data Infographics 
There is an adage in English language that a picture is worth a thousand words. It refers to the notion that complex data and descriptions can be conveyed with just a single picture. So, I am going to make an infographic which shows the real-time data of temperature, humidity and pressure in interactive way. By looking at the infographic people can understand easily the current condition of weather. And the window of infographic can also log data in a text file on command of mouse click.
M5StickC with Arduino programming will be used to process the BME280 sensor data and Processing language is used to create infographic. The data values are also display in M5StickC LCD concurrently with the Infographic.
